Mark Vine’s remarkable new book takes us to the little twin towns of Weymouth and Melcombe, during the height of the English Civil War,  where a conspiracy was to unfold that would engulf every single person that dwelt there and leave more than five hundred dead in its wake.

The Crabchurch Conspiracy is Dorset's bloodiest secret, forgotten for centuries, but whose memory is now being revived through the pages of this book and the annual commemoration weekend.  

“This is a work which brings properly to life the most dramatic and horrific sequence of experiences which this town has ever known, and which put it, at  moments, at the heart of England's destiny.”

_Professor Ronald Hutton_
