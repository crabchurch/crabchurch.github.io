##"Read on, for it is here, and it is written in blood..."

In the seventeenth century, the Sydenham brothers of Wynford Eagle in Dorset achieved fame and notoriety through their heroic exploits during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and early 1650s and thereafter in the fields of politics and most notably, medicine.
 
Theirs' is a story of almost fanatical dedication to their chosen cause and of stoic bravery in the very jaws of death. It is a true tale of intrigue, loyalty, bloodletting and revenge.
 
Largely forgotten now in the mists of time, their incredible saga reached its military peak in Weymouth one cold, dark February night in 1645, the end game of a deadly conspiracy that ultimately caused the deaths of more than five hundred people in that town.
 
Long before the naval or literary Hardys, or the Tolpuddle Martyrs put their County on the more recent historical map, the Sydenham brothers laid down a history so tantalising, so incredible, that it should never again be allowed to fade from memory.
 
They were the ultimate political soldiers and not afraid to get their hands dirty in the heat of battle.
 
Also included in this book for the genealogy researcher are the names of hundreds of ordinary civil war soldiers and civilians.
 
_Foreword by Professor Ronald Hutton of Bristol University._
