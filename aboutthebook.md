##About the Book

The remarkable retelling of a long-forgotten Westcountry saga.

The year is 1645, at the height of the English Civil War.

In the little twin towns of Weymouth and Melcombe a conspiracy is unfolding which could change the course of English history.

'The Crabchurch Conspiracy' is an academic account which is rich in drama and intrigue, a true story of loyalty, revenge and honour told in the prose of a master storyteller.
 
_“This is a work which brings properly to life the most dramatic and horrific sequence of experiences which this town has ever known, and which put it, at  moments, at the heart of England's destiny.”_

_Professor Ronald Hutton_
